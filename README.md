- If I come late tomorrow, here's what I did tonight:

* Created a constants file (we should retrieve the URL from this file).
* Wrote tests for some endpoints.
* Implemented three GET endpoints in a RESTful way.
* Edited json_handler.
* Edited json_migration (without using direct SQL queries).

* (check add_pokemon branch)
